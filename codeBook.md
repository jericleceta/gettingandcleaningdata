### This is the code book for the tidy data set output of the analysis script.

**activity.name**

The activity done by the subject from which the measurements are taken. It is one of six values: LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, and WALKING_UPSTAIRS.

**subject.id**

The subject from which the measurements are taken. It is an integer from 1 to 30.

**Other variables**

The values for the following variables are the average values for the observations for the given activity and subject. The descriptions of the variable names are as follows:

* tBodyAcc-XYZ

	The body acceleration signal

* tGravityAcc-XYZ

	The gravity acceleration signal

* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ

	Jerk signal from body linear acceleration

* tBodyGyro-XYZ

	The body gyro signal

* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ

	Jerk signal from body angular velocity

* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag

	Magnitudes of the vectors above calculated using the Euclidean norm

* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

	Result of applying a fast Fourier transform to the signals above
